sudo (Super User DO) command in Linux is generally used as a prefix of some command that only superuser are allowed to run. If you prefix “sudo” with any command, it will run that command with elevated privileges or in other words allow a user with proper permissions to execute a command as another user, such as the superuser.
apt-get is the command-line tool for handling packages, and may be considered the user's "back-end" to other tools using the APT library.
